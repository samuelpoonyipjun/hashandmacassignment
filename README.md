This is a python project that I wrote regarding cryptography. 
The algorithm was a communication platform between 2 clients and 1 server. 
The messages sent between the clients are encrypted and passes through the server.

This is how the server is supposed to work when it is first being run. 
It listens and connects 2 clients together.

This is the code for one of the clients, client A. 
Client A sends a message to client B saying "Hi Client B".

The message from client A appears in the client B terminal. 
This is how messages are sent between the 2 clients.
